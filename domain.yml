  utter_general/ds_overview:
  - text: "Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses statistical and computational methods to extract insights and knowledge from data, it is used to make informed decisions based on data and has a wide range of applications in the future."

  utter_general/ml_overview:
  - text: "Machine learning is a method of data analysis that uses algorithms and statistical models to enable systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. It is important because it allows systems to improve their performance and adapt to new situations without human intervention."

  utter_general/ai_overview:
  - text: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines, it allows machines to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence and make decisions based on data. It has a wide range of applications in the future and can be implemented in several ways."
